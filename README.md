# CS-UY-4563-Final-Project
The project aims to determine the best machine learning algorithm to predict whether a mushroom species is poisonous or edible. The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Mushroom Data Set.

The dataset contains information about 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota family.

The goal is to determine the classifier with the highest precision.

Results falsely determined to be edible pose a great health risk.
